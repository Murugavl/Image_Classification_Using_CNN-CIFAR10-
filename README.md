# 🧠 Image Classification Using CNN (CIFAR-10)

This project demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained and evaluated on the **CIFAR-10** dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
